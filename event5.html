                <p class="infotoppar"> The 2019 UEFA Champions League final was the final match of the 2018–19 UEFA Champions League, the 64th season of
                Europe's premier club football tournament organised by UEFA and the 27th season since it was rebranded the UEFA
                Champions League. It was played at the Metropolitano Stadium in Madrid, Spain on 1 June 2019, between English sides
                Tottenham Hotspur (in their first European Cup final) and Liverpool (in their ninth overall and their second in a row,
                having been defeated by Real Madrid in 2018). It was the seventh Champions League final – and the fourth of the decade –
                to feature two teams from the same association, and the second all-English final (the first was in 2008). It was also
                the first final since 2013 to not feature at least one Spanish team, with Real Madrid and Barcelona having shared the
                previous five titles between them.</p>

                <p class="infosecondpar">Liverpool won the final 2–0, with a penalty which was scored after 106 seconds by Mohamed Salah and a goal by substitute
                Divock Origi after 87 minutes. As winners, for the sixth time overall and the first time since 2005, Liverpool earned
                the right to play in the 2019 FIFA Club World Cup, as well as against Chelsea, the winners of the 2018–19 UEFA Europa
                League, in the 2019 UEFA Super Cup, winning in both competitions. They also secured qualification for the group stage of
                the 2019–20 UEFA Champions League. As Liverpool had already qualified through their league position, the reserved berth
                was given to Red Bull Salzburg, the champions of the 2018–19 Austrian Bundesliga, the 11th-ranked association according
                to next season's access list.</p>
