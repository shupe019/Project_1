        <h1>Bill Shankly and Bob Paisley</h1>

                <p class="infotoppar"> Bill Shankly and Bob Paisley are widely regarded as the most successful managers in Liverpool FC. They're regarded as
                two of the best managers in English football history.
                
                Shankly was the first of the two to manage Liverpool. He took over the club in 1959 when they were in the English second
                division. He transformed the club's fortunes, and Liverpool was promoted to the English first division in his second
                season.
                
                Bob Paisley was a player for the team. He joined the club in 1939, and he spent his entire career in Liverpool. He made
                250 career appearances for the club as a full-back. Upon his retirement from playing, Paisley became a physiotherapist
                for Liverpool. He worked with the reserves and youth teams.</p>
                
                <p class="infosecondpar">  The club was promoted back into the First Division in 1962 and won it in 1964, for the first time in 17 years. In 1965,
                the club won its first FA Cup. In 1966, the club won the First Division but lost to Borussia Dortmund in the European
                Cup Winners' Cup final. Liverpool won both the League and the UEFA Cup during the 1972â€“73 season, and the FA Cup
                again a year later. Shankly retired soon afterwards and was replaced by his assistant, Bob Paisley. In 1976,
                Paisley's second season as manager, the club won another League and UEFA Cup double. The following season, the club
                retained the League title and won the European Cup for the first time, but it lost in the 1977 FA Cup Final. Liverpool
                retained the European Cup in 1978 and regained the First Division title in 1979. During Paisley's nine seasons as
                manager Liverpool won 20 trophies, including three European Cups, a UEFA Cup, six League titles and three consecutive
                League Cups; the only domestic trophy he did not win was the FA Cup. Paisley retired in 1983 and was replaced by his assistant, Joe Fagan.
