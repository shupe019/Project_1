                <p class="infotoppar"> The 2006 FA Cup final was a football match played between Liverpool and West Ham United on 13 May 2006 at the Millennium
                Stadium, Cardiff. It was the final match of the 2005–06 FA Cup, the 125th season of the world's oldest football knockout
                competition, the FA Cup. Liverpool were participating in their 13th final; they had previously won six and lost six.
                West Ham were appearing in their fifth final, they had previously won three and lost once. This was the last final to be
                held at the Millennium Stadium while Wembley Stadium was rebuilt. Liverpool had won the first final to be held at the
                Millennium Stadium in 2001, when they beat Arsenal 2–1. The match has been called The Gerrard Final due to Liverpool
                captain Steven Gerrard's volleys and is widely regarded as one of the greatest cup finals in the history of the
                competition.</p>
                
                <p class="infosecondpar">Watched by a crowd of 71,140, West Ham took the lead in the first half when Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher scored an
                own goal, and striker Dean Ashton scored a few minutes later to make it 2–0 to West Ham. Liverpool scored, courtesy of
                Djibril Cissé, to make the score 2–1 at half time. They equalised not long after the restart via a Steven Gerrard goal.
                However, ten minutes later West Ham defender Paul Konchesky gave his team a 3–2 lead. With the match in injury time,
                Gerrard equalised from distance to make the score 3–3 and force the game into extra time. No further goals were scored
                in extra time meaning the match was to be decided by a penalty shoot-out. West Ham missed three of their four penalties
                while Liverpool converted three of four to win the shoot-out 3–1.</p>
