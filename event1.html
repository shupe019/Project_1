        <h1>Liverpool FC is Founded</h1>

            <div class="paragraphs">
                <p class="infotoppar"> Liverpool F.C. was founded following a dispute between the Everton committee and John Houlding, club
                    president and owner of the land at Anfield. After eight years at the stadium, Everton relocated to Goodison
                    Park in 1892 and Houlding founded Liverpool F.C. to play at Anfield. Originally named "Everton F.C. and
                    Athletic Grounds Ltd" (Everton Athletic for short), the club became Liverpool F.C. in March 1892 and gained
                    official recognition three months later, after The Football Association refused to recognise the club as
                    Everton.
                    Liverpool played their first match on 1 September 1892, a pre-season friendly match against Rotherham Town,
                    which they won 7–1.
                </p>
                <p class="infosecondpar"> The team Liverpool fielded against Rotherham was composed entirely of Scottish players—the players who came from
                Scotland to play in England in those days were known as the Scotch Professors. Manager John McKenna had recruited the
                players after a scouting trip to Scotland—so they became known as the "team of Macs". The team won the Lancashire
                League in its debut season and joined the Football League Second Division at the start of the 1893–94 season. After the
                club was promoted to the First Division in 1896, Tom Watson was appointed manager. He led Liverpool to its first league
                title in 1901, before winning it again in 1906.
                
                Liverpool reached its first FA Cup Final in 1914, losing 1–0 to Burnley. It won consecutive League championships in 1922
                and 1923, but did not win another trophy until the 1946–47 season, when the club won the First Division for a fifth time
                under the control of ex-West Ham United centre half George Kay. Liverpool suffered its second Cup Final defeat in
                1950, playing against Arsenal. The club was relegated to the Second Division in the 1953–54 season.</p>
