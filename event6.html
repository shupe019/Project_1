        <h1>Liverpool win the Premier League</h1>
        <div class=eventdetails>
            <div class="paragraphs">
                
                <p class="infotoppar"> On 25 June, Liverpool clinched their nineteenth league title – the first since 1989–90 and the first during the Premier
                League era. Upon winning the league, Liverpool claimed the unusual achievement of winning the Premier League earlier
                than any other team by games played (with seven remaining) and later than any other team by date (being the only team to
                clinch the title in June).</p>
                
                <p class="infosecondpar">  
                    Over the season, Liverpool set a number of other English top-flight records, including the most consecutive home wins
                    (24; of which 7 were carried over from the previous season) and the biggest point lead at any time (25). They
                    also matched the Premier League records for the most wins (32) the most home wins (18), and the most consecutive
                    wins (18). Beginning the season prior, Liverpool enjoyed a 44-match unbeaten run in the league, the
                    second-longest streak in top-flight history, behind Arsenal's run of 49 games between May 2003 to October 2004. The
                    team remained unbeaten at home in the league for the third season in a row and finished the season with 99 points,
                    the club's record and the second highest in English top-flight history after Manchester City's 100 two years
                    prior. Liverpool also recorded the best ever start to a season in the history of the top 5 leagues in Europe (as
                    they stood in 2020), picking up 20 wins and 1 draw for a total of 61 points out of a possible of 63; they
                    eventually extended that record to 26 wins and 1 draw for a total of 79 points out of a possible 81 before suffering
                    their first league defeat on 29 February 2020.</p>
