        <h1>New Manager: Jurgen Klopp</h1>
        <div class=eventdetails>
            <div class="paragraphs">
                
                <p class="infotoppar"> Klopp was appointed manager of Liverpool in 2015. He has guided the club to UEFA Champions League finals in 2018 and
                2022, and won the trophy in 2019 to secure his first – and Liverpool's sixth – title in the competition. Klopp's side
                finished second in the 2018–19 Premier League, registering 97 points; the then third-highest total in the history of the
                English top division, and the most by a team without winning the title. The following season, Klopp won the UEFA Super
                Cup and Liverpool's first FIFA Club World Cup, before delivering Liverpool's first Premier League title, amassing
                a club record 99 points and breaking a number of top-flight records. These achievements won him back-to-back FIFA Coach
                of the Year awards in 2019 and 2020.</p>
                
                <p class="infosecondpar">  
                    A 3–2 home victory against West Ham United on 24 February 2020 saw Klopp's side equal the English top-flight records for
                    the most consecutive wins (18) and the most consecutive home wins (21, set by Bill Shankly's Liverpool side in the
                    1972–73 season); the latter setting a record for the Premier League era. Klopp said after the game that he "never
                    thought [Manchester City's win record] would be broken or equalled." A 2–1 win against Bournemouth at Anfield on 7
                    March saw Liverpool set an English top-flight record of 22 consecutive home wins. On 25 June, Klopp's side clinched
                    the title with 7 games left to spare; it was the club's nineteenth league title, its first since 1989–90 and its first
                    during the Premier League era.In the season, Liverpool set a number of English-top flight records including the
                    most consecutive home wins (23), the largest point lead at the end of a matchweek (22), and upon winning the league
                    claimed the unusual achievement of winning the Premier League earlier than any other team by games played (with seven
                    remaining) and later than any other team by date (being the only team to clinch the title in June). Beginning
                    the season prior, Liverpool also enjoyed a 44 match unbeaten run in the league – the second-longest streak in top-flight
                    history – ended by Watford on 29 February. At the end of the season, Klopp was named LMA Manager of the Year
                    as well as Premier League Manager of the Season.</p>
